            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Using degrees to measure angles is a practice that originated in ancient astronomy, and because <m>360</m> is a number that is evenly divisible by a lot of other numbers. However, it turns out that doing Calculus efficiently with periodic functions requires a different measurement using arc length on the unit circle. This is radian measure of angles.

           The <term>radian measure of an angle <m>\theta</m></term> is...
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, a unit of <m>1</m> radian is the measure of an angle that cuts of an arc length of <m>1</m> on the unit circle.

    <p>
        Let's mark off angles with radian measures that are <m>2\pi</m>, <m>\pi</m>, <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, <m>\frac{\pi}{3}, </m><m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>, and <m>\frac{\pi}{6}</m>

    Based on where an angle of <m>\pi</m> radians goes, we can create the following conversion factors for any angles.

<p>
   Each of the problems below gives you an angle and a radius of a circle centered at the origin. Your job is to find the coordinates (<m>x</m> and <m>y</m>) of the corresponding point on that circle. You can do this by using the following ideas.
