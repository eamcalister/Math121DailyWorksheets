                    Point-slope and vertex forms of linear and quadratic functions, respectively, are useful ways to build these functions so that specific properties hold. Today we will review them. Tomorrow we will interpret them as graphical transformations of specific parent functions.

            <p workspace="2in">
                <em>A</em> <term>point-slope form</term> of a linear function <m>f(x) = mx+b</m> is ... 
            </p>
            <p workspace="2in">
                The <term>vertex form</term> of a quadratic function <m>q(x) = ax^2+bx+c</m> is ...

<p workspace="1.5in">
    The most evident reason for these forms occurs when you evaluate the linear function at <m>x=x_0</m> and the quadratic function at <m>x=h</m>. 
</p>
<p>
    However, the vertex form of a quadratic function can show much more. We show this with the following example.
</p>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p workspace="4in">
            Consider <m>f(x) = 3x^2-12x+7 = 3(x-2)^2 - 5</m>. What can we see using the vertex form?
        </p>
    </statement>

</example>
<p>
Thus, we can see

    <li>
        <p workspace="0.5in">
            <fillin characters="50" /><!--The vertex.-->
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p workspace="0.5in">
            <fillin characters="50" /><!--The concavity of the parabola.-->
        </p>
    </li>

        <p workspace="0.5in">

    A good question is how to put a quadratic function into vertex form (also known as <em>completing the square</em>). One easy (and always reliable) way to do it is to proceed as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Set your standard form equal to <m>a(x-h)^2 + k</m> using the given value of <m>a</m> and leaving <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> as unknowns.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Expand and group like terms.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Match coefficients of powers of <m>x</m> to solve for <m>h</m> and <m>k</m>. 
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    (Similar procedures to this appear over and over in later courses.)

    <title>Problems</title>
<p>
    Put each of the following quadratic functions into vertex form and then sketch its graph. (We'll do one together.)
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p workspace="3in">
            <m>f(x) = x^2+8x+3</m>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p workspace="3in">
            <m>g(x) = -2x^2+12x+4</m>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
