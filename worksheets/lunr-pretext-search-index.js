  "body": " Friday Week 1 - Shifts and Reflections of Functions     Introduce four basic graphical transformations of functions: vertical\/horizontal shifts\/reflections.  Introduce even and odd functions.     We will see through the course of the semester that many families of functions are built as graphical transformations of simpler functions. Today we will introduce some of these transformations, and they will follow us through the rest of the class.     Consider the function whose entire graph is given below:    f(x)=x+1  g(x)=-0.5*x+1  a = 1                In the same axes, graph each of the following functions:                           To summarize:     has the same graph as , except  .     has the same graph as , except  .     has the same graph as , except  .     has the same graph as , except  .     has the same graph as , except  .     has the same graph as , except  .

Then check your answer with Desmos.                   A function is even if...  A function is odd if...     Problem  Using the function in the previous problem, is it even, odd, or neither?    "
