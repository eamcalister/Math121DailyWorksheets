Point-slope and vertex forms of linear and quadratic functions, respectively, are useful ways to build these functions so that specific properties hold. Today we will review them. Tomorrow we will interpret them as graphical transformations of specific parent functions.       A  point-slope form of a linear function is ...  The vertex form of a quadratic function is ...     The most evident reason for these forms occurs when you evaluate the linear function at and the quadratic function at .  However, the vertex form of a quadratic function can show much more. We show this with the following example.      Consider . What can we see using the vertex form?    Thus, we can see                          A good question is how to put a quadratic function into vertex form (also known as completing the square ). One easy (and always reliable) way to do it is to proceed as follows:    Set your standard form equal to using the given value of and leaving and as unknowns.    Expand and group like terms.    Match coefficients of powers of to solve for and .    (Similar procedures to this appear over and over in later courses.)
